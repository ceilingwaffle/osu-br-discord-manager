TODO:
  Server:
    ✔ Fix the LetsEncrypt permissions on the server @done(20-03-27 00:45)
    ☐ Install Forever.js
    ☐ Write a post-renew certbot script
      https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#pre-and-post-validation-hooks
  General:
    ☐ Use role.setPoisition() to move the bot as high as possible in the list of roles
    This is so the bot has permission to remove other roles.
    https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/master/class/Role?scrollTo=setPosition
    The issue is that the bot will crash with Discord permission-related errors if the Solos, Duos etc roles already exist before the bot joins.
    Temporary workaround is to manually move the osuMPP role to the top of the roles list in the Discord server settings.
    ☐ Kick users that joined >60 mins ago but have not selected any roles
    ☐ Setup logging
    ☐ Log output to a Discord channel
  Roles Form:
    ☐ The roles form should be loaded with the user's current roles checked
    ☐ Validate that at least one role is checked
